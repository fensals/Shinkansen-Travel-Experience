The goal of the problem is to predict whether a passenger was satisfied or not considering his/her overall experience of traveling on the Shinkansen Bullet Train.

Dataset: 

The problem consists of 2 separate datasets: Travel data & Survey data. Travel data has information related to passengers and attributes related to the Shinkansen train, in which they traveled. The survey data is aggregated data of surveys indicating the post-service experience. You are expected to treat both these datasets as raw data and perform any necessary data cleaning/validation steps as required.

The data has already been split into Train_Data and Test_Data

Target Variable: Overall_Experience (1 represents ‘satisfied’, and 0 represents ‘not satisfied’)
